For years, the EWS team has been dedicated to building open source products that empower developers and teams. Our journey has led to the creation of several innovative tools, but until now, we never had a unified home to showcase our work and connect with our users.

Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of our official website—a central hub where you can discover, explore, and follow all the products developed by the EWS team. Our goal is to bring together our independent projects, making it easier for users and contributors to find, use, and participate in the evolution of our ecosystem.

Some of our products are standalone solutions, each with its own unique mission. For example, Zealot is an open source, self-hosted platform for mobile app distribution and continuous integration. Zealot automates the lifecycle of your apps: connect your CI to build in the cloud, test on real devices, and distribute to beta testers and app stores—all in one place. It’s trusted by enterprises and individuals alike for its flexibility, extensibility, and robust deployment options.

With this new website, we hope to foster a stronger community, provide better documentation, and make it easier for everyone to stay up to date with our latest releases and initiatives. Whether you’re a developer, a DevOps engineer, or an organization looking for reliable open source solutions, we invite you to explore our products and join us on this journey.

Thank you for supporting EWS Studio. We look forward to building the future together!
